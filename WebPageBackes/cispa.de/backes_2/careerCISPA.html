	  I have several open positions for outstanding postdocs and PhD students. My research interests have traditionally been quite broad and encompassed various aspects of information security and privacy. My current research mostly targets trustworthy machine learning in its many facets, and trustworthy information processing in general, but I remain interest in a wide range of different topics.

<h2>Postdoc Fellowship Program</h2>


I have been swamped with postdoc applications in the last years - many more than I managed to even carefully process in acceptable time. To remedy this situation, I have set up a dedicated postdoc fellowship program with explicit application deadlines. The goal of this program is to boost the professional career of a small number of exceptionally strong young researchers. Accepted candidates will have the opportunity to work with me and my group at CISPA for two years, will receive close personal mentorship, generous funding for hiring research assistants, research equipment, academic traveling and research visits.<br><br>


What the postdoc fellowship program offers:

<ul>
<li> A two-year full-time contract (in Germany's salary scale: E13/E14)</li>
<li>  A one-on-one mentorship by me to help you pursue your academic career at the highest level</li>
<li>  Opportunities to work with my world-class faculties and PhD students </li>
<li> Generous base funding for hiring research assistants, research equipment, and academic traveling</li>
<li> Research visits at CISPA's academic partner institutions if desired </li>
</ul>

The requirements you have to meet to be considered for the program:

<ul>
<li> Successful completion of your PhD in CS (or you expect to graduate within the next 9 months)</li>
<li> Exceptional academic achievements already, in the sense of at least two first-author top-tier conference publications (Core A* in security and/or machine learning) </li>
<li> Exceptional commitment to research and to starting an academic career</li>
<li> Strong leadership and communication skills</li>
</ul>
<br>

The <b>application</b> deadline is three times a year: January 30th, May 30th, September 30th<br><br>

Applications have to contain a research statement for the next 2-3 years and an academic CV including a list of publications. Applications should be sent directly to me by email (director@cispa.de)
