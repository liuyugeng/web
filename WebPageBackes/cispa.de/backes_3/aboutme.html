  <h2>Compact CV</h2>
  Michael Backes is the founding director and CEO of the <a href="https://www.cispa.de" target="_blank">CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security</a>.  
  He is moreover a professor of  <a href="http://www.uni-saarland.de/">Saarland
University</a> and the director of the  <a href="https://cispa-stanford.org/">CISPA-Stanford Center</a>, jointly with 
Prof. John Mitchell from Stanford.<br><br>

 
  In his research, Prof. Backes focuses primarily 
  on  trustworthy methods for machine learning, on novel approaches for protecting personal data, and on universal solutions for software and system security. 
  His research results have shaped these scientific fields internationally, as is evidenced by over 300 peer-reviewed and highly 
  cited publications in renowned international journals and conference proceedings.<br><br>

His research has earned him internationally renowned scientific awards and honors, in particular the ERC Synergy Grant, which is Europe's most highly endowed EU group 
research award, the Karl Heinz Beckurts Prize, an ERC Starting Grant, the Caspar Bowden Privacy Award, the IEEE and ACM Fellowship, as well as various Career Awards and Best Paper Awards. 
<br><br>

His research results have regularly been translated into highly innovative applications that have brought him widespread attention beyond the scientific community. 
In particular, Prof. Backes was the first German to receive the MIT TR35 Award, which recognized him as one of the top 35 researchers and innovators in the world under the age of 35 (across disciplines) 
whose “accomplishments are poised to have a dramatic impact on the world as we know it”.<br><br>

Michael Backes is regularly listed in rankings as one of Germany's most important IT personalities. He holds an honorary doctorate from the Université de Lorraine and is both 
honorary citizen and future ambassador of the city of St. Ingbert.
